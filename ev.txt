Many of you might have heard of the electric vehicles,the advancements and the positive effects it has on the our environment.We are constantly bombarded with news on release of new electric vehicles and many of the major automobile companies are competing against each to contribute and grow the revolution.Here,in this article I would like to put forward both faces of the revolution. 

As the population of an country increases,there will be plethora of people who will live and work in cities.Travel within and between cities will grow exponentially.This rapid growth poses several social,economic and environmental challenges.To convert these challenges into opportunities,the country needs to prioritise shared and public moodes of transportation and turn to new sunrise industries that can help combat pollution,reduce congestion and create jobs.

The reason why electric vehicles are the future maybe a cliche thing but I would anyway like to tell. Electric cars and trucks are powered by electricity, which as an energy source is cleaner and cheaper than oil. Even when the electricity comes from the dirtiest coal-dominated grid, electric vehicles  still produce less global warming pollution than their conventional counterparts by reducing or even eliminating carbon emissions to avert climate change.So,more effort is put into powrering the wordl by using only renewables.But,there is scepticism surrounding on why it is difficult to reduce the emissions from vehicles.It's because there is no fully functional and proper infrastructure of charging stations,the rise the other options to electric vehicles like hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the gasoline vehicles are getting more fuel-efficient and the fuel prices are at low levels defer people from buying a electric vehicle.

The cost of key components for electric vehicles,most notably,lithium ion batteries,have been ebbing at rates comparable to declines for LED lamps,solar panels and integrated circuit chips and the rapid scaling of the manufacturing of thse components wil drive down costs,making the vehicles most cost  efficient solutions for travel.THe incentives to buy a electric vehicles are that they save you money as they are cheaper to fuel  that their counterpart and the savings on the maintenance costs,they also offer you a better driving experience and they are convenient in terms of the amount of time you can save by not searching for a gas station,you can charge at your home conveniently.I would like to point certain hurdles that pose a threat to the electric revolution.The element lithium from which energy is obtained to drive the vehicles is a non-renewable resource.Even though as of now we are not running out of lithium,once there is mass production of vehicles it might pose a threat.The demand for metals for  electric vehicles could exceed reserves.Recycling metals at greater rates and responsible sourcing can reduce the demand for batteries.

But the above said factors dont defer the people from being a part of a revolution.Having an Electric vehicle is becoming the new hipster thing.Cars from Tesla are attracting people by designing and providing features to their vehicles which are not quintessential.People are exuberant and are drawn to facilities and incentivies given by the company and the governments.Another sector of transporation where disruption is going to take place is Electric aviation.THe avation technology is rapidly developing.The reasons are that, the major components of airline costs are fuel and maintenance.Electric aircaft delivers a significant price reductions due to their energy efficiency and longetivity of battery-powered motor.AThough this technology can only be implemented on short-haul planes because of the need of high battery energy density required for commercial flights. While some major impediments are still to be overcome,by some estimates we are likely to see shrt-haul electric flights before 2030.Take a look ar the this.https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/bev-phev-range-electric-car

I now would like to turn to country whre I live in,India.A country like mine is moving towards electrification and changing its exisiting infrastructure in order to do so.THe government has taken many initiatives and introduced many schemes inorder to pursuade people.Schemes like Faster Adopotion and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles and the National Mission On Transformative MObility and Battery Storage signal India's commitment to transforming its mobility system.The emergence of new companies that are focused on producing electric vehicles are fueling the transformation which presents India with a powerful opportunity to emerge as a leader in clean and shared mobility solutions,battery manufacturing and renewable energy.
Maybe Electric vehicles are not going to take the market by storm,but its going to be a gradual improvement.
