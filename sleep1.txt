Sleep:A sacrifice to the modern world

"Sleep is the Swiss army knife of health. When sleep is deficient, there is sickness and disease. And when sleep is abundant, there is vitality and health." -Matthew Walker

Sleep is an complex,dynamic and important part of your daily routine,you spend about One-third of your time doing it.Quality sleep and getting enough of it is a essential to survival.Without sleep you cannot form or maintain the pathways in your brain that let you learn and create new memories and its harder to concentrate and respond quickly.Recent findings suggest that sleeps plays a housekeeping role that removes toxins in your brain that build up whie you are awake.Sleep affects almost every tissue and system in the body and the chronic lack of sleep increases the risk of disorders.No one really knows the biological purpose of sleep,it remains as a mystery and this ignorance is the main reason why our society has little regard for sleep.The effect of it is a positive one and we humans are hardwired and attracted to things that are beneficaial for us.So it is good that we follow our instinct.

When it comes to health,sleep palys an important role.Because of the competition all around us and the greed to achieve more and be more successfull has led to the sacrifice of sleep.Students often tend to neglect sleep inorder to prepare for the exams.The effects are stress,headaches and bloodshot eyes.While more sleep won't prevent you from getting sick,skimping on it could efect your body.I would like to point out that a person taking a nap in the afternoon is totally normal,as there are 2 sleep cycles per day.Research shows that taking a nap for a duration of less that 1 hour improves your brain performance and your immune system.If your sleep schedule is interrupted by a busy workweek or other factors, try to make up for the lost rest with naps.Sleep distruption is the sensation of feeling sleepy at inappropriate times or not being able to sleep.Disturpted sleep https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body#1  is closely linked to an increased susceptibility to broad range of disorders,ranging from poor memory,mental and physical reaction times,depression,insonia,obesity,immune impairment.

Now let me turn your attention to the thing that happens when you sleep,dream.Everyone dreams.You spend about two hours each night dreaming but you may not remember most of you dreams.It may help you process your emotions.Some dream in color,while others ony recall dreams in black and white.Dreams reflect the events from the day and people duffering from stress are more likely to have frightening dreams and on the other hand,people who are experiencing low stress and plenty of satisifaction have more positive dreams.It helps you solve problems in our lives,process memories and incorporate memories.https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/dreaming-overview#1
The good news is that while you cannot your dreams directly,you can work on improving your state of mind during the day.

Most of you all would agree that when I say smartphones are one of the major factor in sleep disruption.They are ubiquitous.There is so much of content on the internet,Sometimes I find myself binnge watching tv shows episodes late night.I feel the effects of lack of sleep in the morning,headaches,lack of concentration among many other things.And this continued over a long time is associated with worse physical fitness and academic peroformance.Excessive use could worsen symptons of anxiety and depression.A study conducted shows that many young smartphones users become impatient or frustrated over download speeds. https://news.sky.com/story/young-smartphone-users-hit-by-load-rage-in-less-than-minute-11775353.
Many of you have heard of this phobia called Nomophobia,wherein the individual has a fear of being without the mobile phone,this is because of internet addiction.I think that it is not the phone that creates this compulsion,but rather the games,apps and online worlds it can connect to.

Even though technology seems to be the devil,we can use the same technology to help monitor and regulate our sleep.Millions of people are using smartphone apps, bedside monitors, and wearable items (including bracelets, smart watches, and headbands) to informally collect and analyze data about their sleep.  Smart technology can record sounds and movement during sleep,hours slept, and monitor heart beat and respiration.  Using a companion app, data from some devices can be synced to a smartphone or tablet, or uploaded to a PC.  Other apps and devices make white noise, produce light and use gentle vibrations to help us sleep and wake.

One among the major factors that is responsible to sleep distruption is alcohol https://thesleepdoctor.com/2017/11/15/truth-alcohol-sleep/ .Many use alcohol to help them fall asleep,even though it help you to fall asleep faster it contributes to poor quality of sleep.It affects your circadium rhythm.It is also common to wake up in the middle of the night because the chemicals that allowed the onset of sleep,wakes you before you are truly rested once it subsides.It also leads to more trips to the bathroom.

ON the lighter note, let me introduce a story to you involving Russians and sleep.You may have read about the Russian Sleep Experiment https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Russian_Sleep_Experiment
 online- a lot of people have.It is a harrowing and terrifying tale of five test subjects being exposed to an experimental sleep-inhibiting simulant in a Soviet-era social experiment.I would recommend you to read that and would like to inform that it it not for a timorous heart. 

So,following regular sleep-patterns, keeping your circadium rhythm functioning normally,reducing screen time and alcohol intake and exercing help reduce the chance of sleep trouble and you can witness the boost in mental sharpness and clarity.The improvements in the quality of sleep is worth it.

Tired minds don't plan well. Sleep first, plan later.
